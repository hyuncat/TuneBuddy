# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Backend image for web/api/analyze_api.py (the /analyze, /notedata, /realign
# FastAPI endpoints). Build context is the repo root (not web/api/) because
# the API imports algorithms/ and app_logic/ as siblings, unmodified from the
# desktop app - see analyze_api.py's PROJECT_ROOT sys.path insert.
#
# MUST be built for linux/amd64, e.g.:
#   docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t attune-api .
# PyQt6==6.10.1 (see below for why it's required at all) has no published
# wheel for linux/arm64 - only the source sdist, which needs a full Qt6 SDK
# + qmake to build and was not pursued. On an Apple Silicon Mac, `docker
# build` defaults to the host's arm64 and this fails at the pip install step;
# confirmed empirically (arm64 build fails, amd64 build and a subsequent
# headless `import PyQt6.QtCore` both succeed). AWS App Runner should be
# configured for x86_64, not the Graviton/ARM option, to match.
#
# Python 3.12, not the 3.14 local dev uses: numpy==1.26.4 (pinned here,
# shared with the desktop app's requirements.txt) predates Python 3.14 and
# has no prebuilt wheel for it, so pip falls back to a from-source build that
# fails outright without a full C toolchain - confirmed by actually building
# this image, not assumed. 3.12 is the newest version numpy 1.26.4 ships
# wheels for on all platforms.

# - ffmpeg: pydub's AudioSegment.from_file(..., format="m4a") shells out to
#   it (app_logic/user/ds/AudioData.py) - the only upload format that isn't
#   handled directly by soundfile.
# - libgl1/libegl1/libxkbcommon0/libdbus-1-3/libnss3/libxcomposite1/
#   libxrandr2/libxi6/libxtst6/libfontconfig1/libglib2.0-0: PyQt6 is a hard
#   import-time dependency of algorithms/PitchDetector.py and NoteDetector.py
#   (they subclass QObject for Qt signals this API path never connects to -
#   see web/api/requirements.txt's header comment). No window is ever opened,
#   but the compiled Qt6 .so files still dlopen these shared libraries the
#   moment PyQt6.QtCore is imported, headless or not - without them the
#   import itself fails before any request-handling code runs.
