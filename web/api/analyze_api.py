"""FastAPI /analyze endpoint.

Upload a score (MIDI/MusicXML) + a recording, run Attune's existing analysis
pipeline unchanged, get the results back as JSON. This is a thin adapter, not
a reimplementation: every analysis step below is the same call sequence
app.py/perform.py already make (Recording.load_audio + detect_pitches for
import, PerformTab.analyze()'s note/mistake pipeline for analysis), just
triggered by an HTTP request instead of a button click, and serialized with
the same JsonHandler used for the desktop app's local `.json.xz` cache.

Run (from the Attune project root):
    pip install -r web/api/requirements.txt
    uvicorn web.api.analyze_api:app --reload --app-dir .
