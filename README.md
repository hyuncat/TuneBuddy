### Core features
Two modes
- Performance mode - Play as you would perform the piece, and get graded on your pitch and relative timing
- Practice mode - The score doesn't keep moving until you get the pitch right

Clip score
- Highlight the measures in the score you want to focus on, then "Clip" to analyze just that

Record, save, and upload audio
- Record in the app, save as .wav, and upload it back in next time
- Can compare multiple recording takes against a single score

Robust playback
- Select subset of instruments to play back at any time
- Can even record while instruments are playing (ie, piano accompaniment)

### Algorithms
Built upon:
- PYIN algorithm for pitch detection
- PELT (pruned exact linear time) L2 segmentation for note detection
- String edit algorithm for mistake correction
